# binderpad (prototype 1)

First implementation attempt in March 2021, about 1 week of coding.
A Vue SPA using Laravel 8 as back-end and run entirely on docker, which is not a good way to install it (more like for demo-ing only),
and this was my first Laravel project at the time so the code is messy & no testing was implemented.

Took it down for now, and will come back with a better implementation later.
